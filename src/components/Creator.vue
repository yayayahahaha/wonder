  Hi, I'm <span>鍾維聖</span>, you can call me <span>飛膝(FlyC)</span>
  Graduated from <span>University of Taipei(2015)</span>
  Working so hard at <span>front-end website developing </span>
  Trying to make this world more beautiful by some amazing <span>"Wow~"</span>

  To expect myself won't stuck at the same consideration,
  I prefer call myself <span>"Creator"</span> rather than <span>"Programmer"</span> 
  I hope I fit this title <span>:p</span>

  Get a half year practical training at <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pixnet.net/">Pixnet(痞客邦)</a> (2014)</span>.
  During my practical training,
  I focused at <span>visualizing</span> what the designer wanted.
  Like <span>animating a character</span>, or <span>cut-scenes design</span>.
  In that half year, I met a lot of people who are the best,
  knew several <span>interesting websites</span> about programing,
  a little bit understood how the works work.
  and yes, my animation skill just like a <span>full-power rocket</span>~!!
  ...Well, at least I hope so <span>:p</span>
